        <p>
            Some say the world will end in fire,
                    Some say in ice.
            From what I’ve tasted of desire
            I hold with those who favor fire.
              But if it had to perish twice,
            I think I know enough of hate
            To say that for destruction ice
                 Is also great
               And would suffice.
